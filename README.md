# Arduino Hello PlatformIO

This project is a simple example to demonstrate the use of PlatformIO with an Arduino-based project. It serves as a starting point for developers to explore PlatformIO's features.

## Features

- Basic Arduino setup using PlatformIO.
- Easy-to-understand project structure.
- Ready-to-build and upload to supported Arduino boards.

## Requirements

- [PlatformIO Core](https://platformio.org/install) installed.
- A compatible Arduino board.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/summer-salad-games/arduino-hello-platformio
    cd arduino-hello-platformio
    ```
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., VS Code with PlatformIO extension).
3. Build and upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Connect your Arduino board to your computer.
2. Use PlatformIO to upload the code.
3. Open the Serial Monitor to view the output.
